    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicous chili recipe is 100% vegan, packed with protein, super cheap and incredibly easy to prepare.</p>
    <p>Some ingredients are flexible - the choice of beans is completely up to you and the lentils can easily be swapped with red lentils.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>3 celery stalks, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz.) can diced tomatoes, with juices</li>
        <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz.) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz.) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>fine sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>fresh lime slices, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the onions, carrots, celery, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, lentils, water, black beans, kidney beans, chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt to the Instant Pot. Stir well, but keep in mind that there won't be a lot of liquid in the pot. (The veggies will release more liquid as they cook.)</li>
        <li>Secure the lid and move the steam release valve to Sealing. Press the "manual" or "pressure cook" button, and cook at high pressure for 10 minutes. The pot will take 10-15 minutes to come to pressure before the cooking cycle begins.</li>
        <li>When the cook cycle is over, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes. The Instant Pot screen will read LO:10 when the natural release time has passed. Move the steam release valve to Venting to release the remaining pressure in the pot.</li>
        <li>When the floating valve in the lid drops, it's safe to remove the lid. Give the chili a stir to make sure all of the lentils dissolve in the chili, thickening it. Season the chili with additional salt and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, to taste. I usually add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of lime juice, then adjust by adding more to taste. (If your diced tomatoes are already salted, you'll want to use less.)</li>
        <li>Serve warm, with your favorite toppings. Sliced avocado, chopped green onions, and shredded cheese (if you're not vegan) are popular options with my family. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
